Hey there! :wave:

I'm Rugved, a passionate Computer Engineering and Deep Learning enthusiast currently pursuing my Masters at New York University (NYU) set to graduate in May 2025.

With a robust background of over two years in DevOps at Oracle and a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from the University of Mumbai, my journey in technology has been dynamic and invigorating.

I'm excited to share my experiences, insights, and explorations here!

## I'm Currently Studying...
- Advanced Hardware Design
- High Performance Machine Learning
- Real-time Embedded Systems

## Here are a few things I have worked on...
- [Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/Multimodal-Sentiment-Analysis) - This project explores different methodologies, focusing on fusion techniques that integrate information from three modalities (audio, language, vision) to enhance sentiment analysis performance, and the various architectures that employ them.

- [Continual Learning for Autonomous Vehicles](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/Continual-Learning-for-Autonomous-Vehicles) - Applying the continual learning framework to Autonomous Vehicle setting: predicting steering angles based on the captured images. Experimented with various approaches - Elastic Weight Consolidation, Experience Replay and Temporal Consistency Regularization.

- [Vector Processor Simulator](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/Vector-Timing-Simulator) - A Python-based Vector Processor (VMIPS) functional and performance simulator evaluated on dot product, fully connected layer, and convolutional layer test bench. [[Read more]]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#vector-processor-simulator)

- [ResNets](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/ResNet) - Explored ResNet Models trained to classify images on CIFAR-10 dataset. Finetuned hyperparameters, experimented with ResNet depths and strategies like dropout layers and learning rate schedulers acheiving a test accuracy of 95.37%.

- [Semantic Image Segmentation for Autonomous Vehicles](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/autonomous-vehicle) - This project utilizes semantic image segmentation to enhance autonomous vehicle perception, accurately identifying and segmenting critical elements like drivable surfaces. By leveraging a U-Net model trained on the CARLA dataset, the project achieves an impressive 96% accuracy [[Read more]]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#semantic-image-segmentation-for-autonomous-vehicles)
