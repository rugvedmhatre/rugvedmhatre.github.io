Hey there! :wave:

I'm Rugved, a passionate Computer Engineering enthusiast currently pursuing my Masters at New York University (NYU) set to graduate in May 2025.

With a robust background of over two years in DevOps at Oracle and a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from the University of Mumbai, my journey in technology has been dynamic and invigorating.

I'm excited to share my experiences, insights, and explorations here!

## I'm Currently Studying...
- Advanced Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Parallel and Customized Computer Architecture

## Here are a few things I have worked on...
- [Predictive Analysis of Diabetes within the PIMA Indian Population](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/NYU-Data-Science-Bootcamp/blob/main/Project/Project-Presentation.pdf)

    Leveraging machine learning techniques, the study delves into the analysis of a comprehensive dataset, investigating correlations and patterns to enhance predictive accuracy. [[Read more]]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#predictive-analysis-of-diabetes)

- [Autonomous Vehicle in CARLA](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/autonomous-vehicle)
    
    Simulated a visual perception model to segment the drivable surface from the captured image, and identify lane markings and traffic signs. [[Read more]]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#autonomous-vehicle-simulation)

- [Handwritten Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/handwritten-digit-recognizer)
    
    Implemented a neural network using NumPy arrays to recognize handwritten digits in MNIST dataset. [[Read more]]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#handwritten-digit-recognizer)

- [Pong Game](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/pong)

    Created a childhood-favourite Pong Game using Assembly Language, playing against the computer in single-player mode, or with someone in two-player mode. [[Read more]]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#pong-game)
