Hey there! :wave:

I'm Rugved, a DevOps engineer at Oracle, Mumbai. 

The fast paced life in Mumbai has made me find speed in everyday things. Be it speeding up my codes or enjoying motorsports.

## I'm Currently Working On...
- improving the performance of our CI/CD pipelines by refactoring our codebase using Python
- researching for an NLP Model to speed up the manual process of classifying code errors based on testing reports
- developing a self-healing infrastructure that monitors and resolves server issues faster

## Here are a few things I have worked on...
- [Autonomous Vehicle in CARLA](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/autonomous-vehicle)
    
    Simulated a visual perception model to segment the drivable surface from the captured image, and identify lane markings and traffic signs. [[Read more]]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#autonomous-vehicle-simulation)

- [Handwritten Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/handwritten-digit-recognizer)
    
    Implemented a neural network using NumPy arrays to recognize handwritten digits in MNIST dataset. [[Read more]]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#handwritten-digit-recognizer)

- [Pong Game](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/pong)

    Created a childhood-favourite Pong Game using Assembly Language, playing against the computer in single-player mode, or with someone in two-player mode. [[Read more]]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#pong-game)
