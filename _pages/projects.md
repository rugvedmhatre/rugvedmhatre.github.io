## Multimodal Sentiment Analysis
This project delves into different methodologies for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, with a focus on fusion techniques that integrate information from various modalities to improve sentiment analysis performance, as well as the architectures employing them. We explore Early Fusion, Late Fusion, Tensor Fusion, and their variants, alongside approaches like Multimodal Factorization Model (MFM), Multimodal Cyclic Translation Network (MCTN), and Multimodal Transformer (MulT). Each approach presents unique advantages and challenges, offering a range of tools to address the intricacies of sentiment analysis in multimodal data. Through a thorough review and analysis of these methodologies, this project aims to illuminate the current state-of-the-art in MSA.

## Semantic Image Segmentation for Autonomous Vehicles
This project focuses on semantic image segmentation tailored for autonomous vehicles, with a primary objective of detecting and segmenting various elements crucial for safe navigation, including drivable surfaces, vehicles, curbs, traffic signs, and sky. Leveraging a U-Net model, the project implements advanced deep learning techniques to accurately classify and segment objects within captured images. Specifically trained on the CARLA dataset, the U-Net model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 96%, signifying its robustness and effectiveness in accurately identifying and delineating essential elements for autonomous vehicle perception.
