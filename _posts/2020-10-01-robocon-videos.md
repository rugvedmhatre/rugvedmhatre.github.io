ABU Robocon is a biennial robotics competition organized by the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU). The competition involves teams of students from universities and colleges around the Asia-Pacific region who compete against each other to design, build, and operate robots for a specific task. The theme of the competition changes each year, and the robots are required to perform a series of tasks that reflect the theme.

In 2019, I had the opportunity to participate in ABU Robocon as part of a team of students from my college, DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering. The team was required to design, build, and operate a robot to complete the specific task set by the competition. This was a challenging and exciting experience, as we had to combine our technical skills, creativity, and teamwork to produce a robot that could perform the required tasks to the best of its ability.

As a requirement for the competition, I created video submissions that showcased our robots and it's functions. I shot and edited the videos to make them engaging and informative, and I am proud of the work that I contributed to the project.

To help promote our team and the competition, I also created a short 'Robocon Reveal Video' that was displayed during college events.

In conclusion, ABU Robocon is a fantastic competition that provides students with the opportunity to develop their technical and teamwork skills, and to promote innovation and technology. I was thrilled to be a part of this competition, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have created video submissions that showcased my team's hard work and creativity.
