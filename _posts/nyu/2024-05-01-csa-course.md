The “Computing Systems Architecture” course (ECE-GY 6913) at NYU Tandon, taught by [Brandon Reagen](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brandon-reagen), provides a comprehensive exploration of the fundamental design principles and components of modern computer systems. The course begins with an introduction to instruction set architectures (ISAs), using MIPS as a case study to examine common design trade-offs and implementation strategies. Building on this foundation, students delve into microprocessor design, starting with a single-stage machine and progressing to advanced performance optimizations such as pipelining and out-of-order execution.

The course also explores critical elements beyond the datapath, including the memory hierarchy and techniques to mitigate long-latency events, such as caches, speculation, and prefetching. Key topics include mechanisms for improving instruction-level parallelism, such as branch prediction, and strategies for further reducing memory access latency. If time allows, the course concludes with discussions on cutting-edge topics like dataflow architectures, SIMD/vector processing, and specialized hardware for machine learning. This course is ideal for students seeking a deep understanding of computer architecture and its role in modern computing.

## Course Structure

The grade will be entirely determined by a series of 6 programming labs:
- Single cycle MIPS simulator (10%)
- Pipelined MIPS simulator (25%)
- Cache simulator (20%)
- VM simulator (15%)
- Branch Prediction simulator (15%)
- Out-of-Order simulator (15%)

## Review
The “Computing Systems Architecture” course by Prof. Brandon Reagen is an exceptional deep dive into the inner workings of modern computer systems. Prof. Brandon is an outstanding teacher who has a unique ability to make complex topics both accessible and engaging. His clear explanations and enthusiasm for the subject matter create an excellent learning environment.

One of the course’s standout features is the hands-on labs, which are both challenging and rewarding. These labs simulate how data moves through computer architectures, offering a practical understanding of the concepts discussed in class. A solid grasp of C/C++ is essential for coding these labs, as they demand significant effort and problem-solving skills. However, the course assistants provide invaluable guidance to help students navigate these challenges successfully.

Overall, this course is a must-take for anyone interested in computer architecture. The combination of Prof. Brandon’s exceptional teaching and the rigorous, hands-on labs make it one of the best learning experiences at NYU Tandon. Prof. Brandon is truly one of the finest professors the university has to offer.
