## Why do we learn Machine Learning?
- Everyone has pretty much heard about, or used Machine Learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) like ChatGPT, Siri, Amazon Alexa, etc. It is also mentioned everywhere in the news, and in everyday conversations.
- It is the most recent exciting technology. People say that "AI is the new electricity". Back then, electricity transformed countless industries like transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, communications and more. Now, AI will bring about an equally big transformation.
- ML Applications can range from (relatively) simple tasks like weather prediction to more complex tasks like self-driving cars.
- Due to this, the demand for Machine Learning skills is very vast. 

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of ML Problems
1. Supervised Learning
    - Regression
        - Predict the price of a house based on its size.
    - Classification
        - Predict whether the image is of a cat or a dog.
2. Unsupervised Learning
    - Clustering
        - Cluster similar data points together
3. Reinforcement Learning
    - Learning a game like AlphaGo
    - Robotics
