# Next Steps

## What we have completed
- Looked at foundational steps and models 
    - Regression tasks: (fish weight and housing prices)
    - Classification tasks: (cancer prediction and Iris) Polynomial models
    - Deep Neural Networks
    - Convolutional Neural Networks

## Building on these Topics
- The goal with engineering is to take what we know and try to build on it.
- In case of machine learning; can we use a CNN as a backbone to solve more complicated tasks with more complicated models?
- The best way to do this is to independently learn from various sources.
- What are some resources that we can use?

## Resources to build on your learning
- Finding Code: Github and Machine Learning Mastery
- Finding Papers: There are many great conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML that are constantly publishing papers across topics and fields.ArXiv and SciHub
- Theory: StatQuest, computerphile and 3 Blue 1 Brown on Youtube.

# Supverised Learning
## Object Detection
- Faster-RCNN
- [YoLo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJy0EI3hfSg)
    - Divides the image into nxn grid-cells 
    - For each grid cell,
        - predicts B bouding boxes and it box confidence score
        - Each box will have its class probability
        - All class probability are combined to detect one object

## Semantic Segmentation
- Every Pixel is associated with a class
- Encoder-decoder structure
- Decode using transposed convolution or deconvolution

## Instance Segmentation

# Unsupervised learning
## Generative Models
Generate images, art, speech. Generation architectures can be modified based on the task at hand.

### Benefits and Use Cases
- When dataset collection is difficult or expensive. (For example MRI scans).
- When there is a limit on available data. (With rare cancers, there may not be many positive cases.) (Start of COVID with few recorded cases.)
- Various novel applications. (Generation or Art)

## Autoencoders

## Autoencoder for denoising

## Variational Autoencoders

## GANs: Generative Adversarial Networks
- Invented in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow
- Goal: generate samples never seen before 
- How: game between two networks
    - Generator Network 
    - Discriminator Network
- Goal of Generator: generate fake samples indistinguishable from real samples
- Goal of Discriminator: be able to tell apart real and fake samples

### Applications of GANs
- Cats that Don’t Exist
- Celebrity Faces
- Image Colouring
- Image Synthesis
- Image Super Resolution

# Social Impact of Machine Learning
## How Would You Use ML/DL?
- Think about potential applications with deep learning. 
- Discuss its social implications.

## Can AI/ML be Biased?
- At the start, a Neural Network just has randomly initialized weights.
- It then trains and backprogates on a given dataset.
- Do our nodes harbor any racism, sexism, homophobia or transphobia?
- No!
- Neural Networks aren’t sentient.
- Neural Networks have no understanding of human emotions, biases or anything else.

### Biased model outputs
- [PULSE](https://github.com/tg-bomze/Face-Depixelizer) is a face depixelizing algorithm, but...
- Biases Inherent in Data: CheXpert
    - CheXpert is a dataset of medical images in the form of Chest X-Rays. The dataset is inherently biased as when looking for rare diseases, most patients would test negative.
    - More than 90% of sames are negative cases. As a result, a model can assume every patient is disease free and still have an accuracy of 90%
    - As a result, models aren’t incentivized to learn about underrepresented classes in a dataset.
- Biases not Inherent in Data: Celeb A
    - In case of CheXpert, when studying rare diseases, it is more likely to not have the disease than having it.
    - But sometimes, data in the real world isn’t biased but our dataset might be.
    - Celeb-A is a great case for such a problem.
    - Celeb-A: ”traditionally attractive”. predomintally white and cis. Heavy make-up. Potential Photoshop. 4K cameras.
    - In the real world: Most people not models. People of Colour. Trans and Non-binary. Images aren’t taken on professional cameras with professional makeup.

### Real World Biases leaking into Machine Learning
- Keep in mind, the bias comes from Biased Data!! Not the model having any bigotry.
- Bigotry and under-represented data in the real world can leak into machine learning.
    - Biases and Racism in Law Enforcement can leak into model predictions. This only furthers existing inequity. AI in law enforcement
    - Dataset Generation might often be predominantly white and cishet masculine with the sources of data and the engineers building these datasets not realizing the importance of diversity in datasets.

## Insidious Effects on Machine Learning performance
(From the article Design AI so that it’s fair)
- When Google Translate converts news articles written in Spanish into English, phrases referring to women often become ‘he said’ or ‘he wrote’.
- Software designed to warn people using Nikon cameras when the person they are photographing seems to be blinking tends to interpret Asians as always blinking.
- Google misclassifying people as gorillas,
- Chat bot trained on data from tweets ”Tay” learns to be racist and sexist as a result of the sheer number bigoted twitter users.

How do we solve these issues?

## Safety of AI
[Boston Dynamics Parkour Atlas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sBBaNYex3E): What machine learning algorithms might have been used here?
- The same model can have drastically different performance for different hyper-parameters.
- 100% accuracy is rarely achieved on unseen data.
- Should we let a medical robot with CNN-based vision system perform surgery autonomously?
- If a self-driving car crashes and hurts people, who should be responsible for it?

## Carbon Footprint of Deep Learning

# Course Takeaway
- ML is the combination of math and computer science. We’ve only shown you a subsection
- Supervised Learning: Linear/Logistic Regression and Neural Networks
- Deep learning has wide applications, but we are also responsible for its consequences. —The greater the power, the greater the responsibility!
