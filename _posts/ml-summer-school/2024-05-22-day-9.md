# Final Project
- Task: CIFAR10 or Car classification.
- Simplification: No validation. You can directly tune your network based on the test set accuracy.
- Friday: Present your model performance. 
- Each team should present for 12-15 minutes.

# Presentation Template
- Slide 1: Title and introduction
- Slide 2: Introduce your project: dataset, labels, etc...
- Slide 3: Your network architecture 
- Slide 4: Other hyper-parameters, e.g.
    - optimizer, learning-rate
    - batch size, epochs
    - data augmentation, transformation
- Slide 5: Model performance on training set (loss) and test set 
    - Training loss
    - Test accuracy total
    - Test accuracy for each class
- Slide 6: Challenges and how you resolve them. Slide 7: Conclusion
