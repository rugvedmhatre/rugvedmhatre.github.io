The "International Innovation Challenge Design Contest (IICDC)" hosted by Texas Instruments (TI) in 2019 was a competition that encouraged students, hobbyists, and professionals to design and build innovative projects using Texas Instruments microcontrollers and other electronics components. The competition provided an opportunity for participants to showcase their skills, creativity, and technical knowledge in the field of electronics and embedded systems.

The 2019 IICDC challenged participants to create projects that solve real-world problems in areas such as energy efficiency, sustainable development, and smart cities. The competition encouraged participants to think outside the box and use their technical skills to create innovative solutions to these challenges.

As the contest requirement, the teams had to provide a working prototype and a well-documented design. The participants were also required to provide a detailed description of their project and its purpose, as well as its potential impact on the community or industry.

I had the opportunity to shoot and edit a video for one of our college's participating team. The goal of the video was to highlight the business plan, and the importance of such technologies in solving real-world agricultural problems.

The process of shooting and editing the video was both challenging and rewarding. I had to carefully plan and execute each shot. I also had to be creative and innovative in my editing, using various animation techniques to create a compelling and informative video that engages and inspires viewers.
