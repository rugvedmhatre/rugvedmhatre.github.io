I assisted my college professor in recording a video demonstration of the experiment, which aimed to showcase the working of a single digit BCD adder.

A single digit Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) adder is a digital circuit that performs the addition of two BCD numbers, each represented by a 4-bit binary code. BCD is a way of representing decimal numbers using binary code, where each digit of the decimal number is represented by 4 bits. A single digit BCD adder performs the addition of two BCD numbers, one bit at a time, and outputs the sum as a 4-bit BCD code.

In a single digit BCD adder, the two input BCD numbers are first converted to binary, and then the binary addition is performed. The result of the binary addition is a 4-bit BCD code representing the sum of the two input BCD numbers, which is converted back to decimal to get the result.

The experiment involved using an integrated circuit (IC) to implement the BCD adder, and the video demonstrated the various steps involved in the process, including the circuit setup, input and output signals, and the final result.

My role was to ensure that the experiment was recorded in high quality and with clear audio, so that the viewers could easily understand the details of the experiment. The video was edited to highlight the key aspects of the experiment and to provide a clear and concise explanation of the working of a single digit BCD adder.

Overall, it was a great experience working on this project and contributing to the advancement of knowledge in the field of digital electronics. We are proud to have played a small part in this experiment and hope that the video will be a valuable resource for students and professionals alike.
