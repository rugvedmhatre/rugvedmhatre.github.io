A line follower robot is a type of automated vehicle that is designed to follow a marked path or line. These robots typically use sensors, such as infrared or optical sensors, to detect the line and navigate along it. The line is usually marked in contrasting color to the surrounding surface, making it easier for the sensors to detect.

Line follower robots can be used in a variety of applications, including industrial automation, material handling, and education. 

Me and my team implemented a line follower robot for an undergraduate course assignment. This assignment provided us a simple and accessible introduction to Fabrication of a PCB, Programming of a Micro-Controller, Principles of Robotics and Automation, and PID Control System.

# Microcontroller

We chose an Arduino Uno board as the brains of our robot. It has the following key features that made it suitable for our use case:

- __Microcontroller__: The Arduino Uno uses an Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller, with a clock speed of 16 MHz.

- __Memory__: It has 32 KB of flash memory and 2 KB of SRAM.

- __Input/Output Pins__: It has 14 digital I/O pins and 6 analog inputs.

- __Power Supply__: The Arduino Uno can be powered either from a USB connection or from an external power source, such as a battery or AC adapter.

- __Size and Weight__: The Arduino Uno is a compact board that is small enough to fit on our robot's dimensions.

# Sensors

For the sensors, we had considered the following types:

1. __Infrared sensors__: These sensors use infrared light to detect the line and generate a signal when the light is reflected back from the surface.

2. __Optical sensors__: These sensors use visible light to detect the line and generate a signal when the light is reflected back from the surface.

3. __Reflectance sensors__: These sensors use light to detect the reflectance of the surface, which is used to determine the color and contrast of the line.

4. __Ultrasonic sensors__: These sensors use sound waves to measure the distance between the robot and the line, allowing the robot to follow the line more precisely.

5. __Camera-based sensors__: These sensors use a camera to capture an image of the line and process the image using computer vision algorithms to detect the line and guide the robot.

Out of these, we finally selected infrared sensors for the relatively cheap cost and balanced performance. We interfaced these infrared sensors to an Arduino Uno board. 

# Actuators

For actuators, we selected two DC motors. Using two motors to drive the wheels of the robot, we allow it to move forward, backward, and turn.

DC motors are preferred for line follower robots because they are simple, reliable, and affordable. They are also easy to control, which is important for a line follower robot that needs to respond quickly and accurately to changes in the line it is following.

# Programming Steps

To program our robot effectively, we followed the following steps:

1. __Calibrating the sensors__: Before programming the robot, the sensors must be calibrated to ensure that they are providing accurate readings. This involves testing the sensors under different lighting conditions and adjusting the sensor parameters accordingly.

2. __Setting the line detection threshold__: The next step is to set a threshold for detecting the line. This is typically done by using the calibrated sensor readings to determine the difference between the line and the surrounding surface.

3. __Implementing the line detection algorithm__: The line detection algorithm processes the sensor data and uses it to determine the location of the line. This information is then used to control the robot's movement along the line.

4. __Programming the robot's movement__: The next step is to program the robot's movement along the line. This typically involves using feedback control algorithms to adjust the robot's speed and direction based on the line detection algorithm.

5. __Testing and debugging__: Finally, the robot is tested and any bugs or errors are corrected. This may involve adjusting the line detection threshold, fine-tuning the movement algorithm, or making other changes as needed.

# PID Control

The PID algorithm stands for Proportional, Integral, and Derivative control, and it uses these three control terms to regulate the speed and direction of the robot based on the position of the line.

The steps to implement PID control in a line follower robot are as follows:

- __Measure the position of the line__: Infrared sensor are used to measure the position of the line. This information is fed into the PID algorithm as the input signal.

- __Calculate the error__: The error is calculated as the difference between the desired position of the line and the measured position of the line.

- __Proportional Control__: The proportional term of the PID algorithm uses the error to adjust the speed of the robot in proportion to the size of the error. This helps to quickly correct small deviations from the desired position of the line.

- __Integral Control__: The integral term of the PID algorithm accumulates the error over time, helping to correct for systematic deviations from the desired position of the line.

- __Derivative Control__: The derivative term of the PID algorithm uses the rate of change of the error to adjust the speed of the robot, helping to reduce overshoots and oscillations in the control system.

- __Combine the control terms__: The outputs from the proportional, integral, and derivative terms are combined to generate the final control signal for the robot. This control signal is used to adjust the speed and direction of the robot, based on the position of the line.

- __Repeat the process__: The process of measuring the position of the line, calculating the error, and adjusting the speed and direction of the robot is repeated continually, allowing the robot to accurately follow the line in real-time.

PID control is a powerful and flexible control algorithm that is well suited for use in line follower robots. By using the PID algorithm to control the movement of the robot, we can achieve accurate and stable control, even in the presence of disturbances, such as changes in the line, uneven surfaces, or other environmental factors.
